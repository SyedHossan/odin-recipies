    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> This burrito takes you from inadequate to adequate. From zero to hero. It will make girls like you. The will to live will return. It makes night turn to day. 
        Your grind starts here with this fresh, beefy, simple to make burrito, that will quickly become a tool in your muscle building, weight lifting,
        girl stealing, path. I can't highly recommend this burrito enough. 
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Haram, non Kosher beef (preferably with maximal pain and suffering for the animal)</li>
        <li>One massive flour tortilla. Real mexican tortilla. Mission tortillas suck.</li>
        <li>A quarter onion, diced as small as ur pp</li>
        <li>Mozzerella cheeze on a cut, cheddar on a bulk. A phat pinch of either</li>
        <li>Red Salsa</li>
        <li>Garlic Salt</li>
        <li>Sour Cream</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a big cast iron skilled ripping hot. It has to be cast iron. Other pans are subpar.</li>
        <li>Brown beef till sweaty, add onion a few minutes before beef is done. Add garlic salt liberally. Sodium helps the pump. </li>
        <li>While beef/onions are cooking, lay out one tortilla. Add a tablespoon each of sour cream and salsa to the tortilla.</li>
        <li>Once beef is cooked, add on top of other toppings on tortilla.</li>
        <li>Add pinch of desired cheese</li>
        <li>Roll your burrito. Mandatory to use too much filling. If the tortilla rips you are weak.</li>
        <li><em>optional:</em>Place burrito back on warm skillet seamside down to toast tortilla and seal it.</li>
    </ol>
